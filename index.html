    <h1 class="header1">History of our clan</h1>
    <div class="logo"><img src="rocker bec (1).jpg" alt="rocker_bec"></div>
    <p class="para"> story of the Death Racers Clan begins back in 2018 when a group of seven friends, known only by their numbers—1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7—came together to create a gaming clan named "Rocker." They were bound by their love for gaming and a shared desire to have fun. The early days of Rocker were filled with laughter, late-night gaming sessions, and a strong sense of camaraderie. They didn't care much about competition or rankings; their focus was purely on enjoying the games and each other's company.</p>
    <p>As time went on, their skills improved, and so did their reputation within the gaming community. They began to attract attention not only for their gameplay but also for their unique style and attitude. By 2020, the members decided it was time for a change, something that would better represent their evolving identity and growing ambitions. After much discussion and brainstorming, they settled on a new name that captured their spirit: "Death Racers."</p>
    <p>The name change marked the beginning of a new chapter. Death Racers became known for their high-energy, aggressive playstyle, and their dedication to pushing each other to be better. While they never lost sight of their original goal of having fun, they also started participating in more competitive events, bringing their unique blend of fun and skill to the broader gaming scene.</p>
    <p>Today, the Death Racers Clan stands as a testament to friendship, growth, and the joy of gaming. What started as a casual group of friends having fun has become a well-known name in the gaming community, all while maintaining the sense of camaraderie and fun that brought them together in the first place.</p>
